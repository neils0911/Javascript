<h3>Pizza Menu</h3>

<p>This is a project where I created a function interactive menu for a Pizza shop. The menu takes the topping selection and then calculates a running total for the order.</p>

<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Noughts and Crosses)</h3>

<p>This is the simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses in the UK &#128521). Users take turns until one player wins by getting three Xs or Os in a line.</p>

<h3>Calculator</h3>

<p>A basic four button calculator project. You can add, subtract, divide and multiply.</p>
